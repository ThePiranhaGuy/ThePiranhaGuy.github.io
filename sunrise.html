              <h3 class="subtitle">Darkness Everywhere</h3><br>
               Snow and Snow. All around the land was covered with a white veil, making cracking noise as we moved. All along the vicinity, there was only snow. No vegetation, no trees, no grass, protruded from the vast expanse of the thick white sheet.<br>
A sudden surge of solitude crept over me. My mind flew into the realm of my sweet memories-the memories of my homeland. I could recall the warm summer days, the villages, its lush green meadows and golden fields. I could smell the ripe odour of fruits hanging from the trees. I could feel my cold heart gradually finding the warmth of my mother’s lap. <br>
Oh! These happy days! Those days when sitting beside my grandmother we used to listen to the stories and fantasies. The period when cares and snares of life were far away.<br>
“Give me some water, will you?”<br>
These words penetrated the web of my memories and brought me back to reality. In an instance, I was aware of the surroundings-a vast cold icy desert. All images, the memories of the green fields and warm summer was scattered by a violent storm, of remorse. Nearby lay Collins, cold and calm and cureless.<br>
“Sir!”, Came out of my mouth, then my voice choked. It has been a day since, the ration has exhausted, and there was no water, no tea, no coffee, no food…<br>
The stove had run out three days ago. The only remedy to slake our burning thirst lay in the sucking of icicles. Our throats had swollen and tongue had become soar doing the same again and again.<br>
Mr. Antony Collins had been dying for a gulp of water. At times, he grumbled-usually he was quite. He would cry in agony and then fall unconscious. He would cough and stain the white veiled ground with dyes of red. Distraught with grief and worry, I was tensed about alleviating pains and sufferings of my senior companion. <br>
The only action in my mind suggested was to enjoy the beauty of the foreign country before we all perished. I sat aside, filled my diary and pulled aside the flap to get a view. <br>
              <h3 class="subtitle">Lights Everlasting</h3><br>
               A dark curtain covered the snowy ranges. Blizzards blew all day. Collins was seriously ill, captured by cureless pneumonia and eaten bit by bit by frost bite, and was certainly hovering between life and death. The nerves seemed to become unbearably sensitive and every body part ached with immense pain.
To be frank, I was not in a better condition mentally than Collins. Outside strong gales swept over the land of ice.<br>
Three days had passed. There was a bleak prospect of the blizzards stopping. The only way to survive was to descend to Camp III which was three hundred and seventy meters down to the slope. This was not possible with the blizzards blowing. A month of tireless ascent seems to void of any value.<br>
“Boy! Jonny!”<br>
It was Collins. He called me Jonny ever since we met. ‘Go back Jonny! I am beyond hope!” cried the European, “Leave me to God’s mercy. You go, Jonny, go……”<br>
He fell asleep again. However, outside a miracle seemed to happen.<br>
Through the holes of our tent, came in the rays of hope. The dark curtains lifted. The sun rose and a golden glow spread all over the mountains and the valleys! “In-cre-di-ble!!” I said as I saw the hopes of our survival with the sunrise. I tried to wake up Collins. Overjoyed, he ordered to begin the descent and suddenly stood up but then gangrene had set in due to frost bite and he fell with groaning pain.<br>
We had a sledge. I made him sit on it. After packing up, we set off downhill.<br>
A roaring sound followed by the strong gusts of winds blew over us. It was a rescue team. The chopper came down and hovered above us. We were lifted and we set off. The only thought which arose in my mind was “Good bye! Himalayas”.<br>
Mr. Collins was being given first aid. When out of the blue he asked, “Eh! Jonny! What was your name by the way?”<br>
A mixed feeling of love and happiness filled the heart with ecstasy and I drew closer to him.<br>
